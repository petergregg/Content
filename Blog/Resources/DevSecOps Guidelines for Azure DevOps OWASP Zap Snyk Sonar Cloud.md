# Introduction
Implementing DevSecOps practices in Azure DevOps using OWASP ZAP, Snyk, and SonarCloud can help you integrate security into your software development lifecycle. These guidelines define how to effectively use these tools.

## 1. Pre-Development Phase

   - **Guideline:** Begin considering security during the project's initial planning and design phases.
   
   - **Benefits:** Early identification of potential security risks reduces the cost and impact of addressing vulnerabilities.
   
   - **Implementation:**
     - Conduct threat modeling sessions to identify and prioritize potential security threats using [STRIDE and Microsofts Threat Modeling Tool](https://www.pgdevopstips.co.uk/article/securing-blazor-webassembly-applications-with-microsoft-threat-modeling-using-stride-in-azure-ecosystem#applying-microsoft-threat-modeling-using-stride).
     - Define security requirements and create security user stories.
     - Ensure that security experts are part of the initial project discussions.
